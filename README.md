# Machine learning based region of interest detection in airborne lidar fisheries surveys
This repository contains the code used to create the results and figures in our [*Machine learning based region of interest detection in airborne lidar fisheries surveys*](https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JRS.15.038503) paper, which was published in the [SPIE Journal of Applied Remote Sensing](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-applied-remote-sensing).

For details on how to reproduce results, see the [Yellowstone](Yellowstone/README.md) and [Gulf of Mexico](GulfOfMexico/README.md) READMEs. 

The datasets are archived at [https://zenodo.org/record/5164408](https://zenodo.org/record/5164408).
